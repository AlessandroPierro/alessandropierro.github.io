I am passionate about applying new data-driven technologies to help companies grow, reduce costs, and optimize efficiency. The techniques I'm exploring in my master's program, such as *deep learning* and *evolutionary algorithms*, have great potential for solving optimal control problems, making predictions, and automating processes.

If you are interested in starting a project with me, please feel free to [contact me](#contact).
